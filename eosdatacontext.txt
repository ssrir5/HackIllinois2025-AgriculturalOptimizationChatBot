Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)

The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) detects moisture levels in vegetation using a combination of Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. It is a reliable indicator of water stress in crops.

Why NDMI Matters?

Early Detection of Water Stress: Helps identify water stress before it severely impacts crop yield.
Irrigation Monitoring: Useful in regions where crops require more water than nature provides, improving overall crop growth.
Wildfire Prevention: In fire-prone areas, NDMI can help monitor dry conditions and assess fuel levels.
NDMI vs. NDWI: Understanding the Difference

NDMI is sometimes confused with NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), but they serve different purposes:

NDMI (Gao's NDWI version): Uses NIR and SWIR to measure moisture content in vegetation.
NDWI (McFeeters's version): Uses Green and NIR to detect water bodies and their turbidity.
Thus, NDMI should not be confused with NDWI, as it specifically focuses on vegetation moisture.

NDMI Formula

NDMI is calculated using the reflectance values of Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands:

NDMI = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)

For Sentinel-2 satellite data:

NDMI = (B08 - B11) / (B08 + B11)

Why These Bands?

SWIR: Sensitive to vegetation water content and the mesophyll structure of leaves.
NIR: Reflects from leaf structure and dry matter content.
Combined Use: Provides highly accurate vegetation water content data.
Compared to NDVI, NDMI serves as a better deforestation indicator due to a less abrupt decrease in values.

Interpretation of NDMI Values

NDMI values range between -1 and +1, making it easy to interpret:

Negative values (-1 to -0.2): Indicate bare soil or low canopy cover, often signaling water stress.
Zero to positive values (0 to 0.4): Suggest increasing canopy cover, with some water stress present.
Higher values (0.4 to 1): Represent healthy vegetation with no water stress, but extremely high values may indicate waterlogging.
NDMI Interpretation Table:

-1 to -0.8: Bare soil
-0.8 to -0.6: Almost absent canopy cover
-0.6 to -0.4: Very low canopy cover
-0.4 to -0.2: Low canopy cover (dry or wet)
-0.2 to 0: Mid-low canopy cover, high or low water stress
0 to 0.2: Average canopy cover, high or low water stress
0.2 to 0.4: Mid-high canopy cover, high or low water stress
0.4 to 0.6: High canopy cover, no water stress
0.6 to 0.8: Very high canopy cover, no water stress
0.8 to 1: Total canopy cover, no water stress or waterlogging
Key Considerations

NDMI values fluctuate throughout the growing season as plant reflectance changes.
NDMI and NDVI can be correlated, meaning water stress in NDMI can be confirmed by lower-than-average NDVI values.
When Is NDMI Used?

NDMI is useful for:

Monitoring water content in crops regularly.
Identifying farm zones experiencing water stress.
Planning tree harvest logistics effectively.
Assessing fire risk by determining combustibility in dry areas.
NDMI Visualization

NDMI values are commonly represented through maps and graphs:

Maps: Show the spatial distribution of water stress across fields.
Graphs: Illustrate how NDMI changes over time.
NDMI Color Interpretation

Low NDMI (white to pale brown): Low vegetation water content (water stress).
High NDMI (blue shades): High vegetation water content (healthy crops).
Sudden NDMI decreases: Potential water stress warning.
Abnormally high NDMI: Possible waterlogging issue.
